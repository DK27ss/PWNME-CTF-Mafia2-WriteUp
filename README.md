# PWNME-CTF-Mafia2-WriteUp

## Overview
During the first PWNME qualifications in this weekend (March 28 to 3), there were some pretty cool challenges. So I'm doing a write-up of some of them to deepen my skills and share my results with you.
In this second challenge, following Mafia1, we receive two Solidity files `Casino.sol` and `Setup.sol`.

First we need to start the instance to retrieve the necessary information such as: `UUID`, `CASINO`, `RPC`, `PRIVATE_KEY`, `PLAYER`, `SETUP`, `TARGET`
